# Contributing

We'd love to see you get involved with React-JUCE! Here are our current working guidelines, and we'll be updating and iterating on these as we go.

- Have a question? Please open a Discussion topic, not an issue
- Document every feature request, bugfix, or change with an issue
- Issues that have been assigned to someone should be considered "in progress"
- Issues with no assignee are free to claim. Please assign yourself if you want to tackle an issue to prevent duplicate efforts
- If you don't see an issue for some work you're planning, open one so that we can mark an assignee and further avoid duplication
- Priority will be established by way of labels
- Timelines will be established by way of milestones

# Style Guide

For javascript, typescript, markdown and yaml we enforce default [prettier](https://prettier.io/) formatting via a pipeline check. You can set up your IDE to format automatically, instantiate our formatting pre-commit hook by running `npm i && npx husky install` in the top-level directory, or ad-hoc by running `npm run beautify`.

On the C++ side, we don't yet have a coding style guideline, so please try to adhere to the style you see in the codebase. We will aim to get some tooling involved
soon to ameliorate that situation!

## Thank you
