# Contributing

We'd love to see you get involved with Blueprint! Here are our current working guidelines, and we'll be updating and iterating on these as we go.

* Have a question? Please open a Discussion topic, not an issue
* Document every feature request, bugfix, or change with an issue
* Issues that have been assigned to someone should be considered "in progress"
* Issues with no assignee are free to claim. Please assign yourself if you want to tackle an issue to prevent duplicate efforts
* If you don't see an issue for some work you're planning, open one so that we can mark an assignee and further avoid duplication
* Priority will be established by way of labels
* Timelines will be established by way of milestones

Finally, we don't yet have a coding style guideline, so please try to adhere to the style you see in the codebase. We will aim to get some tooling involved
soon to ameliorate that situation!

## Thank you
