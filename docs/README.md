# Introduction

Blueprint is a hybrid JavaScript/C++ framework that enables a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) frontend for a [JUCE](http://juce.com/) application or plugin. It provides an embedded, ECMAScript-compliant JavaScript engine via [Duktape](http://duktape.org/), native hooks for rendering the React component tree via `juce::Component` instances, and a flexbox layout engine via [Yoga](https://yogalayout.com/).

For more information, see the introductory blog post here: [Blueprint: A JUCE Rendering Backend for React.js](https://nickwritesablog.com/blueprint-a-juce-rendering-backend-for-react-js)

## Examples

Blueprint is a young project, but already it provides the framework on which the entire user interface for [Creative Intent's Remnant](https://www.creativeintent.co/product/remnant) plugin is built.

Besides that, you can check out the example code in the `examples/` directory. See the "Documentation" section
below for building and running the demo plugin. If you have a project written with Blueprint that you want to share, get in touch! I would
love to showcase your work.
