# Introduction

React-JUCE is a hybrid JavaScript/C++ framework that enables a
[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) frontend for a [JUCE](http://juce.com/)
application or plugin.

For more information, see the introductory blog post here:
[React-JUCE: A JUCE Rendering Backend for React.js](https://nickwritesablog.com/blueprint-a-juce-rendering-backend-for-react-js)

## Examples

React-JUCE is a young project, but already it provides the framework on which
the entire user interface for [Creative Intent's Remnant](https://www.creativeintent.co/product/remnant) plugin is built.
