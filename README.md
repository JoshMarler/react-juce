# Blueprint

> Write cross-platform native apps with React.js and JUCE

Blueprint is a hybrid JavaScript/C++ framework that enables a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) frontend for a [JUCE](http://juce.com/) application or plugin. It provides an embedded, ES5 JavaScript engine via [Duktape](http://duktape.org/), native hooks for rendering the React component tree to `juce::Component` instances, and a flexbox layout engine via [Yoga](https://yogalayout.com/).

For more information, see the introductory blog post here: [Blueprint: A JUCE Rendering Backend for React.js](https://nickwritesablog.com/blueprint-a-juce-rendering-backend-for-react-js)

## Status

**Approaching Beta**. We hope to announce a beta release in the coming weeks, after which we will aim our focus at stability and completeness on the path
to a 1.0 release.

**Anticipated Breaking Changes**

- We'll be renaming Blueprint to react-juce before beta (#34)
- ~~Updating the examples and `npm init` template to point to npm instead of the local package~~
- ~~`ReactApplicationRoot::evaluate` and `ReactApplicationRoot::evaluateFile` (#115)~~
- ~~Refactoring the hot reloader and decoupling the EcmascriptEngine from ReactApplicationRoot (#65)~~

## Examples

Blueprint is a young project, but already it provides the framework on which the entire user interface for [Creative Intent's Remnant](https://www.creativeintent.co/product/remnant) plugin is built.

Besides that, you can check out the example code in the `examples/` directory. See the "Documentation" section
below for building and running the demo plugin. If you have a project written with Blueprint that you want to share, get in touch! I would
love to showcase your work.
